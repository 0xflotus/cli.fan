# Welcome

This website is dedicated to command-line tools and interfaces. I have spent my whole career working in the commandline. I'm a true believer in the commandline; it is the best and most efficient interface to the machine. Working just a little closer to the metal means you're steps away from learning about the fundamentals and peeking inside the tools you use to find what happens "under the hood". I love to peel back the layers of the software running on my computers, digging into the internals of my operating system, compiler, and whatever else. This site is a space for that to be shared with the world and with you, dear reader.

Each post I write on cli.fan will highlight a single open source tool that's usable at the commandline. I use unix-like operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin) and will be highlighting tools that work on these operating systems. If you would like to donate a Windows machine to the cause, I'd be glad to cover tools that work there too :smile:

For each post, I'll give the same basic information plus any cool facts specific to this tool. Each tool will have:

- Some sample use-cases (basic and advanced)
- Screenshots or recorded terminal sessions of the tool in use
- Link to the source code
- Quick sense of how "active" the project's development has been recently

I'm going to be coming at most of these tools as an absolute beginner to keep my tone as approacheable as possible. If you have feedback, please send me an email at [root@cli.fan](mailto:root@cli.fan)!
